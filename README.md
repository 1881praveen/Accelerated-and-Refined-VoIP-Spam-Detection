 We employed an approach by identifying the anomalies in the call data frROM 600 thousand users. The approach differentiates between normal and spam callers based on the duration of conversations between two parties. This is achieved by locating anomalies in the call graph. Using call data records, a collection of separating call parameters is used to establish the weights of the edges of a weighted graph. Social interaction among users is utilized by a machine learning model to detect Spam Over Internet Telephony (SPIT). With the availability of the Internet, VOIP is one of the most cost-effective ways to communicate from any location and at any time. First, we must isolate SIP answers inside the pcap-formatted data stream. SIP answers are the responses to SIP queries, therefore they contain information like call length, call status, caller and callee IP addresses, etc. The file is then exported to CSV. Using the KERAS package, a Neural Network Model is constructed after data preprocessing. By simultaneously training three modules (logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest), outcomes were efficiently enhanced. For parallel programming, libraries such as Pymp, Joblib, and Multiprocessing were built.
